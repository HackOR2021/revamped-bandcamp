# Minerva Music App
Web platform for artists to share information regarding their latest tracks and upcoming shows.


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The music industry suffered for performers during the Covid-19 pandemic. We wanted to contribute to social good and create something that gives power to the artist, but an easy listening format for the listener.

This project was built for the [2021 HackOR Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/minerva-music-app), and was awarded 'Best Use of MongoDB Atlas'.

<!-- The project is hosted live on Heroku at https://team-cs-cats.herokuapp.com/ -->

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to make local changes to Minerva, you must first have Python and pip installed on your system. If you need assistance installing these prerequisites, see the folowing steps:

* Python is a programming language. Almost all of this project's code base (particularly the backend) is written in Python. Download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install onto your local machine.

* Pip is the package installer for Python. Once Python is installed, open your local machine's command line and use the following command to utilize Python to install Pip:
```sh
python get-pip.py -g
```

Git is a version control system. In this project, Git is used to clone (copy) the most up-to-date project files from GitHub to your local machine. Download the latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install on your local machine.


### Installation (will change based on project setup) 

1. Open the command line on your local machine.

2. Enter the following command to use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/HackOR2021/revamped-bandcamp
```
3. Create a virtual environment called `env` within your local cloned repository.
```sh
virtualenv env
```
4. Activate the `env` virtual environment.
```sh
env\Scripts\activate.bat
```
5. Enter the following command to use Pip to install this repository's dependencies.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. To run a local copy of the website on your local execute the `run.py` file.
```sh
python run.py
```
7. On your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. This will update to saved changes in your local directory upon refresh.
8. Occasionally, some of the built-in resources (particularly the javascript scripts) of this project do not update when reloading changes made to files. To bypass these errors, reload the web page and bypass the cache. This can be done using the `Shift + left click Reload button` on Firefox or by entering developer mode on Google Chrome and selecting the `Empty Cache and Hard Reload` option.
